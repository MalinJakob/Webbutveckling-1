        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!

          My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and very active 26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but I’m originally from Malmö in Skåne. Before my adventures in Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to train as a professional dancer at the Royal Swedish Ballet School. My training lasted for three years, and I graduated with a professional dancer’s diploma in June 2018. I would say I have many homes!
          
          <br>I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance teacher since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself since I was 3. This shows that I am a highly engaged and motivated person. The combination of being both a coach and a student has taught me to show respect, follow instructions, give instructions, take responsibility, and master leadership. <br> Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business with my partner. We operate a small web agency called <b>MW Webbdesign</b>, and we have created websites for, among others, the Chalmers student portal for Industrial Engineering.Link to the page: <a href="https://i-chalmers.se/">I-Chalmers</a>. I handle the design, and my partner takes care of the system development.</p>
