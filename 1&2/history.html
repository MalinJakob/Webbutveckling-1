          <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and very active
          26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but I’m originally from
          Malmö in Skåne. I lived in Malmö with my parents and older sister. My
          life in Malmö was all about school and dance. Sometimes friends and
          family but mostly school then dance then some more dance. I was
          dancing around 35 hours per week, crazy huh? Before my adventures in
          Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to become a professional dancer
          at the Royal Swedish Ballet School. My training lasted for three
          years, and I graduated with a professional dancer’s diploma in June
          2018. On that note, I would say I am a girl with many homes!

          <br />I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance teacher
          since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself since I was 3
          . I have always been a highly engaged and motivated person. <br />
          Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business with
          my partner. We operate a small web agency called <b>MW Webbdesign</b>,
          and we have created websites for, among others, the Chalmers student
          portal for Industrial Engineering. Link to the page:
          <a href="https://i-chalmers.se/">I-Chalmers</a>. I handle the design,
          and my partner takes care of the system development.

          <pre>When I was looking at code before <abbr title="University">Uni</abbr> it looked like Japanese. 
            A lot of characters with no meaning, "£$2©∞§£§@]±. And text everywhere 
          but it seemed to look out of place. Just like 
                  this paragraph..@©≈$[∞ƒ‘ßœ©ç’≈•≈‘</pre>
