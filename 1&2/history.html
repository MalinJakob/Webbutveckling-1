          <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and very active
          26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but I’m originally from
          Malmö in Skåne. In Malmö I lived with my parents and older sister.
          During my life in Malmö I occupied my with quality time with my family
          but mostly school then dance then some more dance. I was dancing
          around 35 hours per week, crazy huh? Before my adventures in
          Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to become a professional dancer
          at the Royal Swedish Ballet School. My training lasted for three
          years, and I graduated with a professional dancer’s diploma in June
          2018. On that note, I would say I am a girl with many homes!

          <br />I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance teacher
          since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself since I was 3
          . I have always been a highly engaged and motivated person. <br />
          Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business with
          my partner. We operate a small web agency called
          <b>MW Webbdesign</b>, and we have created websites for, among others,
          the Chalmers student portal for Industrial Engineering. Link to the
          page: <a href="https://i-chalmers.se/">I-Chalmers</a>. I handle the
          design, and my partner takes care of the system development.

            and Anna Maxstad in 2016. See the whole video in fullscreen in a new

            These logos are created by me in the summer of 2023. The logos are
            the "same", they are just saved in different format regarding
            transparency, interlacing and bit depth.
