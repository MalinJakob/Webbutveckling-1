          </header>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and very active
            26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but I’m originally from
            Malmö in Skåne. I lived in Malmö with my parents and older sister.
            My family but mostly school then dance then some more dance. I was
            dancing around 35 hours per week, crazy huh? Before my adventures in
            Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to become a professional
            dancer at the Royal Swedish Ballet School. My training lasted for
            three years, and I graduated with a professional dancer’s diploma in
            June 2018. On that note, I would say I am a girl with many homes!

            <br />I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance
            teacher since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself
            since I was 3 . I have always been a highly engaged and motivated
            person. <br />
            Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business
            with my partner. We operate a small web agency called
            <b>MW Webbdesign</b>, and we have created websites for, among
            others, the Chalmers student portal for Industrial Engineering. Link
            to the page: <a href="https://i-chalmers.se/">I-Chalmers</a>. I
            handle the design, and my partner takes care of the system
            development.

              These logos are created by me in the summer of 2023. The logos are
              the "same", they are just saved in different format regarding
              transparency, interlacing and bit depth.
