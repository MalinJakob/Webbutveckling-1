          The plan is to learn more about programming and computers in general.
          I plan to do this while finishing my third year at
          <abbr title="University of Gothenburg">GU</abbr>. After this I am
          going to apply for a master in <dfn>Interaction Design</dfn> at
          Chalmers.

            <h2>Obstacles in The Future</h2>
            <p>
              I am going to be a woman in a man dominating profession
              and now, beforehand, it is hard to comprehend how it will effect
              me. I hope in a positive way so I can contribute back in the
              same matter, but you never know. I do not really think I see it
              as an obstacle because I can stand my ground and know my worth,
              nevertheless, I have never been exposed to that type of
              environment before so it is hard to know exactly how i will act.
